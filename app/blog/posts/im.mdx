## Birth
Hi, my name is Igor Matheus. I was born in november 19, 1997 in the state of Ceará, Brazil.
A very fun fact about my birth is that I was born in the same day as my mom, in november 19. 
She chose to have me born in the same day as her birthday. She talked about it with her doctor and he agreed.
Both of my parents are retired. I have a close relatitonship with my mom, I love her and I'm very proud of her.
My dad used to works with bikes and my mom was a public teacher. 
I have an younger brother and a older half-sister by my father's side.
